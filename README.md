# ZK based Health Records/Data Sharing Marketplace

## Built on top of the following tech stack

ZK based Health Records/Data Sharing Marketplace is built on top of the following tech stack:
- `Noir` (for ZK Circuit)
- `zkVerify` (for ZK Attestation)
- `EDU Chain` (for deploying smart contracts)
- Solidity / Foundry (for smart contract development)
- Next.js / React (for front-end)

## Overview

In the **drug descovery** space, which is one of space in **DeSci**, there are problems for the following actors respectively:
- For a **Health Data Provider** (i.e. patient, wearable device holder like Apple Watch holder), there is negative situations that their unnecessary sensitive informations may also be leaked when they share their health records/data with Medical Researchers. Also, there is lack of incentive to share their health records/data with Medical Researchers. 
- For a **Medical Researcher**, there is lack of access to large amount of the health records/data, which the data integrity is kept, to be analyzed for developing new drugs. Also, there is lack of transparent marketplace of them. These are one of cause of that makes the speed (pace) of new drug discovery slower.

The ZK (Zero-Knowledge) based Health Records/Data Sharing Marketplace, which is built on top of **Noir** and **zkVerify**, can resolved the problems above by applying ZK (Zero-Knowledge) cryptographic techniques and smart contract/blockchain in order to securely share (buy/sell) sensitive health records/data while maintaining strong privacy protections. 
This allow for more collaborative and open medical research (in DeSci space) without compromising individual privacy. 

In the Marketplace where buy/sell a Health records/data, there are the following 2 actors:
- **Seller**: **Health Data Provider** (i.e. patient, wearable device holder like Apple Watch holder)
- **Buyer**: **Medical Researcher** (who want to analze Health records/data for developing new drugs)

_The advantage for a Health Data Provider (Seller) is that:_
- A Health Data Provider can share (sell) their health data without sensitive data (i.e. Age, Name).
  - NOTE: In the ZK circuit in Noir of this project (`./circuits/src/main.nr`), whether or not the `age` of a Health Data Provider is above 18 would be validated.

- A Health Data Provider can choose which data they want to share (as the `"Selective Disclosure"` feature) 
  - NOTE: In the ZK circuit in Noir of this project (`./circuits/src/main.nr`), the `"Selective Disclosure"` feature can be seen. 

- In exchange for sharing (selling) their health records/data, a Health Data Provider can earn the rewards (fees) as a financial incentive, which is paid by a Medical Researcher when the Medical Researcher buy their health data.

_The advantage for a Medical Researcher (Buyer) is that:_
- A Medical Researcher can securely collect (buy) a health records/data that the data integrity is kept by **ZK Proof**, which is generated in **Noir** and attested by **zkVerify**.

- A Medical Researcher can securely collect (buy) a health records/data from the transparent market thanks to transacting on the **smart contract** based marketplace.

## Archtecture and Userflow

- Archtecture and Userflow: 
  - The actual functionality of the ZK based Health Records/Data Sharing Marketplace would be implemented in the HealthDataSharingExecutor contract (`HealthDataSharingExecutor.sol`).

## DEMO Video

### Basic information of DEMO Video
- DEMO Video link: https://youtu.be/mpMr7RNzpJM
  
- In the DEMO Video above, there are 2 pages:
  - The page for a Health Data Provider (URL: `http://localhost:3000`)
  - The other page for a Medical Researcher (URL: `http://localhost:3000/medicalResearcherPage`)

- Both pages can work - after locally running the frontend app in the `./app` directory by the `npm run dev` command. 

<br>

### Description of DEMO Video


<br>

### Limitation of DEMO Video

- Input data (Health records/data) must be inputted via the `Prover.toml` (`./circuits/src/Prover.toml`) to generate Noir's UltraPlonk Proof and zkVerify's UltraPlonk Proof.
  - In the future, these input data should be inputted via UI.

## Deployed-smart contracts on EDU Chain (testnet)

| Contract Name | Descripttion | Deployed-contract addresses on EDU Chain (testnet) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| ZkVerifyAttestation | [zkVerify ZkAttestation Contract on EDU Chain](https://docs.zkverify.io/relevant_links#zkverify-links) | [0x147AD899D1773f5De5e064C33088b58c7acb7acf](https://edu-chain-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0x147AD899D1773f5De5e064C33088b58c7acb7acf) |
| UltraVerifier | The UltraPlonk Verifer contract (`./circuits/target/contract.sol`) based on ZK circuit in Noir (`./circuits/src/main.nr`), which is generated by the [Noir's Solidity Verifier generation](https://noir-lang.org/docs/how_to/how-to-solidity-verifier) | [0x71F3108Be6F52D59fdc220C2aFd21B3721Bf5fb7](https://edu-chain-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0x71F3108Be6F52D59fdc220C2aFd21B3721Bf5fb7) |
| HealthDataSharingVerifier | The smart contract that the validation is implemented for the UltraVerifier contract, which is generated by [Noir's Solidity Verifier generation](https://noir-lang.org/docs/how_to/how-to-solidity-verifier) | [0x23C6269f0807bFc14ab91A7d32Ad9b643B96cA1A](https://edu-chain-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0x23C6269f0807bFc14ab91A7d32Ad9b643B96cA1A) |
| HealthDataSharingExecutor | The smart contract that works as the ZK based Health Records/Data Sharing Marketplace | [0x097eB4757edba7D2c398411C07091A5Ac8ce9FEe](https://edu-chain-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0x097eB4757edba7D2c398411C07091A5Ac8ce9FEe) |

NOTE: Basically, the HealthDataSharingExecutor contract would work as the Health Records/Data Sharing Marketplace.

## Installation
- Install libraries
  (NOTE: Before this installation, all folders should be removed under the ./lib directory)
```shell
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
forge install 0xnonso/foundry-noir-helper
```

```shell
cargo install --features bins --path .
```

(NOTE: If the outdated-version of the `ultraplonk_verifier` is already installed, the following command should be used instead of the command above)
